internal rate of return (IRR) is a potent financial measure used in financial analysis, accounting, and portfolio management to gauge the profitability of investments.\nIt's like the heartbeat of an investment -- an indicator of health, the higher it is, the better the investment.\nThis powerful tool can help investors compare different investment options, assisting in making informed decisions about where to allocate their capital.\nEspecially when cash flows are irregular, as often is the case in real-world scenarios, IRR becomes invaluable.\nThis article will first explain the concept and calculations behind IRR and then demonstrate how to implement an IRR algorithm in Rust.\nIRR vs. XIRR terminology\nThe IRR is the rate of return that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from a particular investment equal to zero.\nIt's sometimes used for cash flows at regular, usually annual, intervals.\nI will not make this assumption in this article.\nWhile Microsoft uses the name XIRR for its Excel function, I will use the term IRR throughout this article, even though the cash flows do not occur at regular intervals.\nExample data and validation\nA crucial part of implementing a financial algorithm like IRR is validation -- that is, making sure that your algorithm is producing correct and expected results.\nOne effective way to validate your implementation is by comparing its outputs to those of Microsoft Excel's XIRR function.\nI will use the data from the Excel example.\nUsing Excel's XIRR function to compute the internal rate of return for this specific data set yields a result of $37.34\\%$.\n$\\textbf{i}$ISO Date $\\textbf{d}$Years since first cash flow $\\textbf{y}$Payment $\\textbf{p}$\n12008-01-010.0000-10,000\n22008-03-010.16442,750\n32008-10-300.83014,250\n42009-02-151.12603,250\n52009-04-011.24932,750\n\nHow IRR works\nThe IRR is calculated by finding the rate of return that would make the net present value (NPV) of an investment equal to zero.\nThe NPV is the sum of the present values of all future cash flows from an investment.\nThe derivative of the NPV is used to find the IRR.\nThe derivative of the NPV is the rate of change of the NPV with respect to the interest rate.\nThe IRR algorithm is an instance of the Newton-Raphson method,\nwhich is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.\nTo calculate the IRR, you need an array with pairs of data: one is the date of a cash flow, and the other is its payment amount.\nYou also need an initial guess for the IRR rate, which is often set as $10\\%$ or $0.1$.\nHere's the general process of the algorithm:\n\nCompute the net present value (NPV): The NPV is calculated by summing the present values of the individual cash flows.\nCompute the derivative of the NPV: The derivative of the NPV with respect to the rate is created by differentiating the NPV formula and summing these values. \nUpdate the guess: The next guess for the rate is calculated by subtracting the ratio of the NPV to its derivative from the current guess.\nIterate until convergence: These steps are repeated until the change in guesses is below a certain tolerance, or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.\nAt this point, the guess for the rate is considered to be the IRR.\n\nCompute the net present value (NPV)\nHere, $y_i$ represents the number of years that have passed since the first cash flow,\ncalculated as the difference in days between the date of the $i$-th cash flow $d_i$ and the date of the first cash flow $d_1$,\ndivided by 365 (days in one year).\nI have pre-calculated it in the table above:\n$$y_i = \\frac{d_i - d_1}{365}$$\nThe NPV is the sum of all payments, where the correct interest rate $irr$ is applied.\nIts value is 0 after all transaction have been concluded:\n$$\\mathit{NPV} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{m} \\frac{p_i}{(1 + irr)^{y_i}}$$\nWhen you plot the NPV function as a function of $irr$,\nyou are essentially varying the interest rate and observing how it affects the NPV.\nHere's what you see on the graph below, which plots the NPV as a function of the rate with the values from the table above:\n\nX-axis: The x-axis represents the interest rate $irr$.\nIt typically ranges from $0\\%$ to a reasonable upper limit, depending on the context of your problem.\nY-axis: The y-axis represents the net present value NPV.\nIt's the cumulative sum of the discounted cash flows according to the given formula.\nShape of the curve: The curve of the NPV function will generally be downward-sloping.\nThis is because as you increase the interest rate $irr$, the present value of future cash flows decreases.\nHigher interest rates mean that future cash flows are being discounted more heavily, which reduces their present value.\nBreak-even point: There will be a point on the graph where the NPV curve intersects the x-axis.\nIt's where our $irr$ satisfies the condition $\\mathit{NPV} = 0$.\nFor our data, it is somewhere between $0.35$ and $0.40$, or $35\\%$ and $40\\%$.\n\n\nThe above formula is a sum of function terms.\nApplying the superposition principle,\nwe can split the sum into individual function terms, which look all the same.\nFor each cash flow, we have a function term, which is the present value of the cash flow.\nThe important part is that we can apply this principle to the NPV function and the derivative of the NPV function.\nWith $irr$ written as $x$, each function term looks like this, where $p_i$ and $y_i$ are just constants.\n$f_i(x)$ represents the NPV for a single cash flow, the $i$-th one:\n$$f_i(x) = \\frac{p_i}{(1 + x)^{y_i}}$$\nThe amount $p_i$ is discounted in the NPV calculation to reflect the time value of money. Here's an explanation for why that's done:\n\nTime value of money: Money available today is worth more than the same amount in the future because of its potential earning capacity.\nThis core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received.\nDiscounting future cash flows: In the context of the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV), this principle is applied to future cash flows.\nThe $p_i$ represents a payment (cash flow) at some future date. To compare this future value to present values,\nit needs to be discounted back to its value in today's terms.\nThe discount factor: The expression $\\frac{1}{(1 + x)^{y_i}}$ serves as a discount factor, where $x$ is the internal rate of return, and $y_i$ is the number of years that have passed since the first cash flow.\nThis factor is derived from the formula for compounding interest in reverse (discounting rather than compounding).\nSum of discounted payments: The NPV is the sum of these discounted payments. By discounting each future cash flow back to its present value,\nthe NPV provides a consistent basis for comparing the value of cash flows across different time periods.\nUnderstanding the equation: The equation $f_i(x) = \\frac{p_i}{(1 + x)^{y_i}}$ represents the present value of the $i$-th cash flow.\nIt shows how each cash flow is discounted back to present value terms using the discount factor.\n\nDiscounting the $p_i$ in the NPV calculation allows for a proper comparison of cash flows across different time periods,\ntaking into account the time value of money and the specific internal rate of return (IRR) required from the investment.\nIt ensures that future cash flows are appropriately weighed against the potential earning capacity of money in the present.\nBut what happens if ...\nThe expression $(1 + x)^{y_i}$ can become a problem if $x &lt; -1$ (less than $-100\\%$), because raising a negative number to a non-integer power will result in a complex number.\nWithin the realm of real numbers, this operation is undefined.\nFor example, consider a case where $x = -1.1$ and $y_i$ is a floating point number like $0.4$.\nThen, $(1 + x)$ will be negative, and raising it to the $y_i$ power produces a complex value:\n${(1 - 1.1)}^{0.4} \\approx 0.12 + 0.38 i$\nIn the context of finance and the calculation of IRR, it doesn't make sense to have complex numbers as they don't have a practical interpretation in terms of cash flows or discount rates.\nTherefore, you would typically ensure that the rate $x$ stays within the range where the calculation remains within the realm of real numbers.\nIf you're working with cash flows and discount rates, you may want to either avoid or handle situations where $x &lt; -1$ by constraining the value of $x$ within a reasonable range or taking some other specific action if $x$ falls outside that range.\nIn practice, it's rare that you would come across this scenario.\nCompute the derivative of the NPV\nWe can now apply the basic differentiation rules to get the derivative of $f_i(x)$.\nIt represents the derivative of the NPV for a single cash flow, also the $i$-th one:\n$$f_i'(x) = \\frac{-y_i \\cdot p_i}{(1 + x)^{y_i + 1}}$$\nUpdate the guess\nThe Newton-Raphson method is an iterative process used to locate the roots of a differentiable function, i.e. a solution for $x$ where $f(x) = 0$.\nThe method begins with an initial estimate $x_n$, which is then refined into a more accurate guess, $x_{n+1}$.\nThis stage is where the NPV and its derivative come into play.\nInstead of solely employing $f_i(x_n)$ and $f_i'(x_n)$ for a single cash flow, we incorporate all the cash flows by adding up the NPV terms and derivative terms respectively:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac{\\sum_{i = 1}^{m} f_i(x_n)}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{m} f_i'(x_n)} $$\nIterate until convergence\nInstead of improving the result indefinitely, you stop when the difference between $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ is smaller than or equal to a given $\\epsilon$, i.e. $\\left| x_n - x_{n+1} \\right| \\le \\epsilon$.\nIt's usually a very small number, like $0.000001$ ($1.0 e^{-6}$).\nThis is the value used in Microsoft Excel's XIRR function.\nIt's also worth noting that despite using the exact derivative, the IRR algorithm is still an approximation method.\nIt may not always converge to a solution, especially for cash flow series that have multiple changes in sign.\nIn these cases, it may be necessary to provide a good initial guess for the rate, or to use a different method to compute the internal rate of return.\nImplementation in Rust\nLet's move towards translating our theoretical understanding into a concrete implementation using Rust.\nWe'll focus on implementing the IRR calculation algorithm by applying the findings and formulas mentioned in the previous sections.\nThe final output should be close to Excel's XIRR function result within an acceptable tolerance range.\n\nThe calculate_irr function is where the heart of our IRR calculation lives.\nIt starts by defining the initial guess for the IRR, then enters a loop that calculates the new guess, checks for convergence, and continues the loop if not converged.\nFinally, if the algorithm fails to converge, it returns a non-number.\nThe main function uses an example transaction set and calls our calculate_irr function.\nBonus: implementation in JavaScript\nJavaScript runs natively in all modern browsers and is the lingua franca of the web.\nBy translating the Rust code into JavaScript, the IRR calculation will be easily usable on virtually any device, regardless of operating system or hardware.\nThis way, it should be possible to use it in a web application, or even in a mobile app using a framework like React Native.\nMaybe you want to write a financial app that runs on iOS, Android, and the web?\n\nConclusion\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) is an instrumental financial measure that helps investors compare and decide between different investment opportunities.\nCalculating it can get complex due to irregular cash flows, making a detailed understanding of the underlying algorithm crucial.\nThis article dived into the mathematics behind IRR calculation and provided a concrete implementation using the Rust programming language.\nRemember, IRR is not just a number but an insight into the potential of an investment, assisting you in making informed financial decisions.\nIf you have any questions, need further clarification, or want to give feedback: please let me

is a sliding puzzle that consists of a square with tiles numbered from 1 to 15 in random order with one tile missing.\nTo solve the puzzle, you must place the tiles in order by moving tiles to the empty space.\nHow to play\nPlay the game online by clicking/tapping on the tile you want to move.\nOnly tiles neighboring the empty space can be moved.\nOnce you solve the puzzle, the tiles will not move anymore.\nJust play a new game by clicking the button.\nI can guarantee you that every game presented here is solvable.\nRead below for an explanation.\nHint: if your browser doesn't display the board correctly, try clearing your browser cache and try again.\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n

line - like a book.\nSome smart people have figured out, that an even parity (is dividable by 2, like 42) is an invariant of a solvable permutation of the Game of Fifteen.\nIn computer science, an invariant is a condition that is always true, i.e. doesn't change for a section of code. \nThe parity of a permutation is simply the number of inversions.\nAn inversion happens when an element with a lower index has a higher value than a value at a higher index.\nExamples:\n\n1, 2, 3 has no inversions, all elements are in order\n2, 3, 1 has two inversions, because 2 is greater than 1 and 3 is greater than 1 \n1, 3, 2 has only one inversion, 3 is greater than 2\n\nThere are about 1.3 Trillion (Billion for us people in Central Europe) possible permutations of the numbers 1 to 15.\nOnly half of them have an even parity.\nWhen we calculate a random permutation for the start of a game, it then makes sense to filter out all the permutations with an odd parity.\nBecause we do not want to present an unsolvable game.\nHere is a fragment of source code that calculates the parity and checks if it's even for the examples from above.\n\nSource code\nI have created this GitHub Gist with the complete HTML page including the JavaScript source code.\nIt runs in the browser and uses just Tailwind CSS for styling and plain ES6-style JavaScript.\nThe source code can be used for all square board sizes, not only 4 by 4.\nYou have to adjust the boards GUI or dynamically generate it - it's easy. \n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/game-of-fifteen/","title":"The Game of

enable it in the front matter of your blog post by setting the value for extra.diagram to true:\n\nConfiguring the Appearance\nThe shortcode supports an optional init parameter, that allows you to specify configuration options for Mermaid,\nparticularly changing the appearance of the diagrams through the theme.\nFor example, to apply the forest theme:\n\nProviding init Configuration\nWhen using the init parameter, the configuration should be a string wrapped in double quotes.\nInside this string, use single quotes for keys and values.\nHere's a more advanced example with multiple configuration options:\n\nIn this example, we're using the forest theme and changing the primary color to red (#FF0000).\nNote: Ensure that you use single quotes inside the double quotes for the

Mermaid"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tail-recursion-with-trampoline/":{"body":"In case your platform lacks support for proper tail call optimization, and you want to do functional programming, you might run into stack space problems.\nThis can be mitigated, but you have to find a way yourself to make it work.\nThe specific platform I'm writing about here is Node.js.\nAfter a little introduction, I show one well-known solution to the problem.\nIn functional programming, recursion is a fundamental concept to handle mutability.\nPure functional languages like Haskell do not allow mutation of variables, so you have to come up with a different solution to the problem.\nWhat you do is called update as you copy.\nYou create new variables by calculating their values from the values of existing ones.\nBut you never assign a new value to a variable that already has one. \nRecursion\nTo simplify the reasoning, I will assume that a function does not rely on or modify external state, i.e. values of variables outside of its body.\nMath is organized this way: 1 + 2 = 3 independently of e.g. the current weather outside.\nIt's always true, no matter what.\nIn order to write a useful recursive function, you have to make sure that it:\n\neventually returns with a value (terminates)\ncalls itself\n\nBy using these criteria for a recursive function, you can see that it has to either call itself or terminate.\nWhen it terminates, it's done, and you have a value.\nOtherwise, it will call itself, and you get another stack frame with this call.\nDepending on the number of calls this function makes to itself, the used stack space grows, and you might eventually run out of stack space.\nThis is not a good thing!\nTail recursion\nWhat if you do not need the current stack frame anymore, once you make your recursive call?\nYou could immediately forget it, throw it away, or reuse it, thereby saving stack space.\nBut you have to make sure that you need no information from this stack frame once you have made your next call.\nThis can be accomplished by returning the recursive call alone, not adding to it or modifying it once it returns, so the return value can be directly passed on.\nNow you have what's called a tail-recursive function.\nTail call optimization\nOnce you have made sure that your function is tail-recursive, your runtime environment or compiler can optimize the calls in such a way,\nthat the existing stack frame is reused by the next call.\nThe stack thereby never grows, and you have eliminated the potential for a stack overflow.\nBut it's not enough that it can be optimized, it has to be actually done.\nAnd that's where the problem starts.\nNot every runtime environment or compiler performs tail call optimization.\nAs of this writing two of the platforms that I use do not support tail call optimization out-of-the-box:\n\nNode.js\nJava Virtual Machine (JVM) with Java 8\n\nThe JVM does support tail call optimization when used with Kotlin or Scala though.\nNot all is lost: were tail call optimization is not directly supported you can implement a workaround that is straight forward.\nIt's effective in saving you from stack overflow errors.\nThe rest of this article shows you how to implement it.\nIt's known under the name trampoline device.\nI use the factorial function and implement it in different ways, starting with a loop that mutates values.\nFactorial is defined for natural numbers without the 0 (1, 2, 3, ...).\nFactorial(n) calculates the product of all numbers between 1 and n.\nIt serves as an example that I chose because it's easy to understand. \nI'll then transform it to a recursive function and show you how to make this function tail-recursive.\nAfterwards I introduce the trampoline device and apply it to a function that is the modified tail-recursive function.\nLet's start.\nLoop\nIf you're an imperative programmer you would implement the factorial function with a loop.\nYou start with a variable result that has the value 1 and then have a for-loop that starts at 2 and goes up to n.\nIn the body of the for-loop you modify result and set it to a value that was its previous value multiplied by whatever value your loop-variable has.\nIf you are done with the loop you return the result.\n\nSomething to note here is that your result variable does not contain the result.\nIt holds the result only when the execution reaches the return statement.\nHow do you effectively name a variable that has different meanings during its life cycle?\nRecursive with info left on the stack\nHow do you slice a carrot?\nAlthough there are many possible ways to do it, one would be to cut off one slice from one end and then repeat the procedure with the rest of the carrot, until there's nothing left.\nYou do the same with whatever is left until you reach the terminating condition.\nIt's a recursive definition.\nAnd it's essentially what you do to calculate the factorial in a recursive way.\nTo calculate the factorial of n you multiply n with the factorial of n - 1.\nYou now have to calculate the factorial of n - 1.\nAnd so on.\n\nYou need the result of stackFactorial(n - 1) before you can return from the function call, because you have to multiply it with n before that can happen.\nWhat n actually is, is stored in the context of your current stack frame.\nThe next call will have another stack frame, where n has another value.\nBecause you cannot forget the n of the current call, the current stack frame has to stay around.\nWith large n this can lead to a situation where you get an error and the entire process stops: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.\nRecursive without info left on the stack\nWhat can be done about it?\nAs a first step, you can eliminate the need for the current stack frame once you made the next call.\nBut you somehow have to preserve information that's needed.\nThe solution is to pass all required information on to the next recursive call.\nAn extra parameter is needed to hold this information.\nIt's commonly called an aggregator, or agg for short.\nFor multiplication, you start at 1 (identity, n * 1 === n and 1 * n === n).\nAlong the way, you multiply the aggregator with the current value of n, thereby keeping track of how far you've come with the product.\nThe aggregator will look like this over time:\n\n1\n1 * n\n1 * n * (n - 1)\n1 * n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)\netc.\n\nWhen you finally hit 1 for n, you simply return the aggregator, because it already contains the correct result.\n\nAs you can see, the call tailFactorial(...) is directly returned, no information from the current stack frame is required anymore.\nAlternative function signature\nEven though you invoke tailFactorial(5), the definition has two parameters, n and agg.\nThe aggregator has a default value, so you need not provide it.\nBut since it's exposed in the function's interface, someone can call tailFactorial(5, 0) and get a wrong result.\nBecause nobody should mess with agg, it's better to hide it.\nWrap it with a function that only allows the parameter n and make it an inner function of that wrapper function.\nWithin that wrapper function, pass the call on to the inner function.\n\nI will not use this alternative function signature, because it's too verbose and not helping me make my point.\nStill, I highly recommend that you do not expose parameters in your function interface that are neither needed nor intended for public access. \nReturning a function without calling it\nInstead of having the tail-recursive function make the tail call itself, it returns a function (with no arguments) that can call the recursive function with all arguments already in place.\nThis is called a thunk.\nYou then simply have someone to call that thunk, because the tail call is no longer made by the function.\nIf that's returning another function, you call it again. And again.\nUntil the final value is returned.\n\nSince the function returns either a value or another function without calling it, it is neither recursive nor tail-recursive anymore.\nThe stack cannot grow, and you will not run out of it.\nBut if your first call does not give you the final result, you end up with just another function and not with the result.\nDevice for pulling out functions and calling them\nSince you simply pull functions/thunks out of your factorial function until the final value is returned (instead of yet another function), you have to set up a device that's doing just that.\nThe device is called a trampoline, and it is handed a function that returns either thunks or a final value.\nIf a call to that function results in another function, it is called for as long as the returned type is a function.\nOtherwise, it returns the final result.\n\nPutting it into action\nYou have two things right now, a function that is returning thunks and another function that can call these thunks for as long as needed, i.e. the final result is returned.\nThe last thing that's left to do is to join these two functions together.\n\nAll this is for Node.js and JavaScript. For Java 8 you might have a look at this article.\nTail recursive Fibonacci numbers\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined like this: F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.\nFor all n &gt; 1 you calculate them with F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2).\nThis is a recursive definition.\nWhat is different from the factorial example used above?\nYou need two independent information, the two previous values of the function.\nWhen you want to solve the problem with tail recursion, instead of one aggregator parameter, you need to pass two aggregator parameters to the function: the two previous values.\nAs a rule, you need an additional parameter for every additional information that you need in the body of your function.\nInterestingly, n is used as a counter, going down to 1, but the function works its way up to the higher values.\nFor each call, the previous value becomes the current value from the previous call, while the current value is set to current + previous.\nUntil the function terminates for n === 1.\n\nYou can wrap it in a function with only one parameter for n, which hides the aggregators current and next if you want.\nLike in the example above, the original function becomes an inner function of the wrapper function.\nAs I recently found out, Fibonacci numbers also have a closed-form expression:\n$$F_{n}={\\cfrac {1}{\\sqrt {5}}}\\left({\\cfrac {1+{\\sqrt {5}}}{2}}\\right)^{n}-{\\cfrac {1}{\\sqrt {5}}}\\left({\\cfrac {1-{\\sqrt {5}}}{2}}\\right)^{n}$$\nAs an aside: we were estimating story points during a sprint planing.\nStory points roughly follow the Fibonacci numbers, so it's natural that the topic pops up from time to time.\nSomeone was asking if there was a closed-form expression for Fibonacci numbers, so we searched for an answer. And voilà ...\nUsing the trampoline device together with the modified tail-recursive Fibonacci function is left as an exercise for the reader.\nHint: you have to modify the tail-recursive Fibonacci function to return a function/thunk instead of returning the result of a recursive function call.\nFinal thoughts\nI use the trampoline device because Node.js does not support tail call optimization (TCO).\nAt one point I thought that Node.js would eventually support TCO through its use of Google's V8 engine. Google was actively working on supporting TCO in V8.\nBut it turned out that Google is no longer pursuing this path.\nSince tail-recursive functions are particularly useful in functional programming, it's extremely frustrating to see so little progress.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tail-recursion-with-trampoline/","title":"Tail Recursion with Trampoline"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/calculating-internal-interest-rate/":{"body":1181,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/game-of-fifteen/":{"body":228,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/mermaid/":{"body":233,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/blog/tail-recursion-with-trampoline/":{"body":1067,"title":3}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
